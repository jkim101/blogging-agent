Check the cost of recent pipeline runs.

Look at the pipeline logs for token usage data:
- Per-agent input/output token counts
- Per-agent API call counts
- Total pipeline token usage and estimated cost

Use Anthropic pricing to calculate costs:
- Opus 4.6: $15/M input, $75/M output
- Sonnet 4.5: $3/M input, $15/M output

Monthly budget target: $20
