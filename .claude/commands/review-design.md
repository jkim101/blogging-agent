Review the current implementation against the design document.

1. Read `docs/Blogging_Agent_System_설계서.md` for the full specification
2. Check CLAUDE.md "Current Status" checklist for progress
3. Compare implemented code against each design section:
   - §3: Agent specifications (7 agents)
   - §5: HITL checkpoints
   - §7: State design (PipelineState fields)
   - §8: Feedback loop (Critic → Writer rewrite)
   - §14: Project structure

Report any gaps between design and implementation.
